I'm an engineer, open-sourcer, digital nomad, and ride-or-die TypeScripter.

I got into open-source while trying to start a medical record software company as a solo developer. Sadly, the business side never took off, but the technical challenges I encountered have kept me busy for years now :) Managing the complexity of an app with over 200 highly-connected tables made the limitations of current API design and state management tools exceedingly clear. My open-source projects are tools I built to manage all this complexity, but they're broadly useful to anyone who wants to build APIs in a type-safe, reliable way.

I built and currently maintain [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) ‚Äî a TypeScript schema validation library with advanced type inference. I also wrote the initial proof of concept for [tRPC](https://trpc.io), though the modern incarnation is entirely built and maintained by [@katt](https://github.com/katt).

Sponsorship at any level is massively appreciated! üôè
